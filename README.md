# Stockbot-Project

A hobby project to create a stock trading bot

## About

I have recently gained interest in AI programs. I'm not sure how backpropogation works yet, or how I would calculate loss for buying and selling stock over time. Instead, I used a custom evolutionary algorithm to trade stock. This bot trainer comes with training data (although you can always generate new data) and two realtime matplotlib graphs to track training.

## Bugs

I'm sure there are bugs in this. While no-one would use this professionally anyway, be warned.

## Customizing

There are fields at the top of the program that can be changed. These can change the starting money, amount of bots, mutation variation, and more.

DATA.bots is the training data, stockbot.py is the trainer
